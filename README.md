## [EarthQuake Prediction Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/LANL-Earthquake-Prediction)

## Forecasting earthquakes is one of the most important problems in Earth science because of their devastating consequences. Current scientific studies related to earthquake forecasting focus on three key points: when the event will occur, where it will occur, and how large it will be.![alt text](http://getwallpapers.com/wallpaper/full/3/6/0/830812-full-size-earthquake-wallpapers-2048x1366.jpg)

## Data Description:

The acoustic_data input signal is used to predict the time remaining before the next laboratory earthquake (time_to_failure).

The training data is a single, continuous segment of experimental data. The test data consists of a folder containing many small segments. The data within each test file is continuous, but the test files do not represent a continuous segment of the experiment; thus, the predictions cannot be assumed to follow the same regular pattern seen in the training file.
